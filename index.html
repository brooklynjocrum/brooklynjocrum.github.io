            <p>Hallo! Ich hei√üe Brooklyn Crum und ich bin ein Junior bei Florida Gulf Coast University. Or in other words, hello my name is Brooklyn Crum and I am a junior at Florida Gulf Coast University. As you can see from my opening, I can speak German and with that have spent time in Germany. At FGCU, I am pursuing a double major in Accounting and Mathematics as well as a minor in German. During my time at FGCU, I have gained many different skills from the opportunites that I have had and the organizations I am involved in. During my time at FGCU, I had the opportunity to spend three months studying abroad in Germany. I was able to take classes as well as partake in an internship. This summer brought many opportunites to learn, travel, and use my German speaking skills. My passion is working with students and helping them reach there full potential both in and out of the classroom. Upon graduation, I plan to have completed my teacher certificate and become a high school math teacher. I also hope to eventually open my own business someday down the road.
                <br>
                <br>
                I take pride in my work ethic. My involvement on campus, the jobs I have performed, and the community service that I have done, would show that I have excelled in time management. My classmates, peers, and colleagues would say that I am a great leader and work well with everyone. I am very organized and proactive and work hard. I am not afraid to ask questions and continue to do tasks until they are done right. Check out the below information to find out more about me!!
